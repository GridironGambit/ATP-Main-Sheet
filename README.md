Pretty straightforward. I am using GitHub to store snapshots of my main ATP sheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xth9_du7_qZ18Gm-4vb7CoWF82XBK2gFc_0LW3MOdEs/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

The collection of snapshots + their timestamps proves that the results are generated as a result of probabilities + staking computed before each event
